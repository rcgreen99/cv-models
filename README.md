Collection of the most important models in Computer Vision. Written in PyTorch by myself for learning purposes.

Timeline

2012 - AlexNet - Breakthrough in ImageNet Challenge using Neural Networks

2014 - VGG - 

2015 - ResNet - Added residual connections which allowed for better and deeper models

2020 - ViT - Tranformer based CV model beat performance of CNN's on classification

2021 - Swin Transformer - Improved over original ViT and used across a wider range of tasks.

2022 - ConvNeXt - Achieved equal/better performance than Swin Transformer using only CNN's
