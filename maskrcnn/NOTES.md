# Mask R-CNN

## Abstract

Extends th Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. In Janurary 2018, it scored top results in all three of t he COCO suite challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box detection, and person keypoint detection. Their conceptually simple and minimal overhead to the Faster R-CNN make it a solid basline for instance-level recognition.
